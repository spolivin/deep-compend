-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Many current nlp systems and techniques treat words as atomic units. There is no notion of
similarity between words, as they are represented as indices in a vocabulary. This choice has
several good reasons - simplicity, robustness and observation that simple models outperform complex
systems trained on less data.
