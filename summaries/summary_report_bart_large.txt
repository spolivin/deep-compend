Deep convolutional neural networks have led to a series of breakthroughs for image classiÔ¨Åcation.
With the network depth increasing, accuracy gets saturated and then degrades rapidly. There exists a
solution by construction to the deeper model: the added layers are identity mapping, and the other
layers are copied from the learned shallower model. We present comprehensive experiments on imagenet
to show the degradation problem and evaluate our method.
