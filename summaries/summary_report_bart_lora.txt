-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
We develop new techniques for learning highquality word vectors from huge data sets with billions of
words, and with millions of words in the vocabulary. We use recently proposed techniques for
measuring the quality of the resulting vector representations, with the expectation that not only
will similar words tend to be close to each other, but that words can have multiple degrees of
similarity. We design a new comprehensive test set for measuring both syntactic and semantic
regularities, and show that many such regularities can be learned with high accuracy.
